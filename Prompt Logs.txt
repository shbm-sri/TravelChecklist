You're an expert website designer. I need to create an application to keep a checklist of all items I need during my travel. Below are the requirements -
1. Have different categories like Clothes, accessories, Skincare, Documents, Tickets, Car related, Hiking, Air Travel, International Travel, etc
2. Give an option to save the data. Once user clicks on 'Save', create a .json file in the root folder and dump all the data.
3. Use the .json file everytime the application loads.
4. Give a uniform Add Item button for each category, that add a new entry. Don't do it in popup, just append to the existing UI and let users Edit there.
5. Give an option to Delete an Item or Category
6. Upon successful save, give a banner indicating data was successfully saved.

Keep the UX and UI very intuitive and easy to use.
Ensure the UI is not cluttered and can adapt on multiple screens.
Ensure the colors are aesthetic and give a feel of travel mode.
Don't use heavy libraries, keep it plan and simple so that it's easier to debug and understand.
I don't need a backend or a database for this. Do it in place.
